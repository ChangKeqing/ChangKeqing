## Android Calendar App

This repository includes a minimal Android calendar application located in the `AndroidCalendarApp` directory. It demonstrates a simple `CalendarView` in `MainActivity`.

### Building

To build the application, open the project in Android Studio or use the Android command-line tools with the Android SDK installed:

```bash
cd AndroidCalendarApp
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The resulting APK can be found under `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
